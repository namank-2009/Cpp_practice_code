    /*
    Discussion:
    - reinterpret_cast simply reinterprets the bit pattern. No checking, no type safety.
    - Reading or writing memory this way is undefined behavior unless you know exactly what you're doing.
    - Platform/architecture assumptions (like endianness, size, alignment) can break code that uses reinterpret_cast carelessly.
    - Use reinterpret_cast only for low-level system programming, hardware interfaces, unions, and serialization libraries.
    - Prefer safer casts (static_cast, const_cast, dynamic_cast) for normal C++ code.
